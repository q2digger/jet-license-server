# jetbrains-license-server
A dockerized JetBrains License Server based on server_jre_8.

## Getting Started
Getting started with jetbrains-license-server is easy:

1. Configure the license server using the environment variables below
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Navigate to your license server (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
4. You should be prompted to log in to your JetBrains account to configure the license server. *Your license server data will be stored in the mounted data directory so that the license server configuration is persisted across restarts.*
